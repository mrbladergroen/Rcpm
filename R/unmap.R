#' @title Dummy matrix for an outcome factor
#' 
#' @description Converts a class or group vector or factor into a matrix of indicator variables. 
#' I got this function from the mixOmics package.
#'
#' @param classification A numeric or character vector or factor. Typically the distinct entries of 
#' this vector would represent a classification of observations in a data set.
#' @param groups A numeric or character vector indicating the groups from which 
#' \code{classification} is drawn. If not supplied, the default 
#' is to assumed to be the unique entries of classification.
#' @param noise A single numeric or character value used to indicate the value of 
#' \code{groups} corresponding to noise.
#' @param ... Catches unused arguments in indirect or list calls via \code{do.call}.
#'
#' @return
#' An \emph{n} by \emph{K} matrix of \emph{(0,1)} indicator variables, 
#' where \emph{n} is the length of samples and \emph{K} the number of classes in the outcome.  
#' 
#' If a \code{noise} value of symbol is designated, the corresponding indicator 
#' variables are relocated to the last column of the matrix. 
#' 
#' Note: 
#'   - you can remap an unmap vector using the function \code{map} from the package \pkg{mclust}.
