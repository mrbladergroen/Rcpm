\title{
  Dummy matrix for an outcome factor
}
\description{
  Converts a class or group vector or factor into a matrix of indicator variables. 
}
\usage{
  unmap(classification, groups=NULL, noise=NULL, \dots)
}
\arguments{
  \item{classification}{
    A numeric or character vector or factor. Typically the distinct entries of this
    vector would represent a classification of observations in a data set.
  }
  \item{groups}{
    A numeric or character vector indicating the groups from which
    \code{classification} is drawn. If not supplied, the default
    is to assumed to be the unique entries of classification.
  }
  \item{noise}{
    A single numeric or character value used to indicate the value of
    \code{groups} corresponding to noise.
  }
 \item{\dots }{
     Catches unused arguments in indirect or list calls via \code{do.call}.
  }
}
\value{
  An \emph{n} by \emph{K} matrix of \emph{(0,1)} indicator variables,
  where \emph{n} is the length of samples and \emph{K} the number of classes in the outcome.  

  If a \code{noise} value of symbol is designated, the corresponding indicator 
  variables are relocated to the last column of the matrix. 
  
  Note: 
  - you can remap an unmap vector using the function \code{map} from the package \pkg{mclust}.
