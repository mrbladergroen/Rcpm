\description{
vip is an implementation of the Variance Importance in Projection, as described in Chong, Il-Gyo & Jun, Chi-Hyuck, 2005, Performance of some variable selection methods when multicollinearity is present, Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems 78, 103â€“112. It currently only works with single-response ortghogonal scores plsr models.
